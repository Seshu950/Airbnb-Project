In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings, using real-world data to uncover trends and insights for hosts and investors. I focused on identifying factors influencing customer ratings, assessing the impact of location and property type on booking frequency, and analyzing customer preferences. By working with 90+ features and using Tableau for visualizations, I provided key insights to improve listing performance, optimize guest satisfaction, and increase revenue.
